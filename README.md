Peer-graded Assignment: Course Project: Shiny Application and Reproducible Pitch

There are no more current topic than the Covid-19. As the 'Shiny Application and 
Reproducible Pitch' I've made a quick visualization of the Hungarian fatality 
and share of positive tests. It's the seed of a prediction project but just the
first explanatory step, hence please do not expect any fancy thing.

You can find the project on the following github link: 
<https://github.com/hollipista/CovidHunShinyPred>

Further information about the data: <https://atlo.team/koronamonitor/>

And here is the shiny app: <https://hollipista.shinyapps.io/CovidHunShinyPred/>

Assigment instructions:

This peer assessed assignment has two parts. First, I will create a Shiny application and deploy it on Rstudio's servers. Second, I will use Slidify or Rstudio Presenter to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about your application.

Review criteria:

The application must include the following:
Some form of input (widget: textbox, radio button, checkbox, ...)
Some operation on the ui input in sever.R
Some reactive output displayed as a result of server calculations
You must also include enough documentation so that a novice user could use your application.
The documentation should be at the Shiny website itself. Do not post to an external link.

Your presentation must satisfy the following
It must be done in Slidify or Rstudio Presenter
It must be 5 pages
It must be hosted on github or Rpubs
It must contained some embedded R code that gets run when slidifying the document
